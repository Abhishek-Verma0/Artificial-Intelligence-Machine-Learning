# Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my AI/ML learning journey! This repository documents my step-by-step progress, starting from basic machine learning models to advanced neural networks. ðŸš€

It will also contain some random small project done to get more understanding of the concepts .

## Overview
This repository will cover my exploration and implementation of various concepts in AI and Machine Learning, including:

1. **Fundamentals of Machine Learning**  
   - Introduction to ML
   - Data preprocessing
   - Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

2. **Basic ML Models**  
   - Linear Regression
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees

3. **Intermediate Topics**  
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)
   - Feature Engineering

4. **Advanced ML Concepts**  
   - Ensemble Learning (Random Forest, Boosting)
   - Hyperparameter Tuning
   - Model Evaluation and Optimization

5. **Deep Learning Basics**  
   - Introduction to Neural Networks
   - Activation Functions
   - Backpropagation

6. **Neural Networks & Beyond**  
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
   - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)



## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Goals
1. Understand core ML concepts.
2. Implement models from scratch.
3. Apply AI/ML techniques to real-world datasets.
4. Continuously improve and optimize model performance.
