## 🔧 Installation
To install NumPy, simply run:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## 📝 Basic Usage
Here's a quick example to get started with NumPy:
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(a.shape)  # Output: (2, 3)
```



## 🎯 Goal
This repository serves as a structured learning resource for anyone looking to master **NumPy** from scratch to advanced levels.
