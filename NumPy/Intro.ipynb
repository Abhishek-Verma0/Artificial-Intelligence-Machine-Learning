    "Vectorization describes the absence of any explicit looping, indexing, etc., in the code - these things are taking place, of course, just “behind the scenes” in optimized, pre-compiled C code. Vectorized code has many advantages, among which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  *  vectorized code is more concise and easier to read\n",
    "\n",
    "   * fewer lines of code generally means fewer bugs\n",
    "\n",
    " *   the code more closely resembles standard mathematical notation (making it easier, typically, to correctly code mathematical constructs)\n",
    "\n",
    "  *  vectorization results in more “Pythonic” code. Without vectorization, our code would be littered with inefficient and difficult to read for loops.\n"
