# TensorFlow Basics: Tensors & Matrices

Welcome to the **TensorFlow Basics** repository! This repository introduces fundamental concepts of **Tensors** and **Matrices** in TensorFlow, providing explanations and code examples to help you understand the basics.

## What is TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google that enables numerical computation and deep learning applications.

## What are Tensors?
Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that serve as the backbone of TensorFlow computations. They can be scalars, vectors, matrices, or higher-dimensional structures.

## What are Matrices?
Matrices are 2D arrays of numbers, commonly used in linear algebra and deep learning for transformations, multiplications, and representations of data.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to Tensors
- Creating Tensors in TensorFlow
